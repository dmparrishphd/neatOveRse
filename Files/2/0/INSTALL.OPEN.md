# Installing from Open-Packages

You should be able to use something a lot like [00-six.R](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/neatOveRse/blob/master/Files/2/0/00-six.R) to install and attach the open packages
(by default 0, 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 4/0, 5/0, and 6/0).

The order of installation you specify should respect the _imports_ and _depends_
(see the DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files of the package[s] in question).
